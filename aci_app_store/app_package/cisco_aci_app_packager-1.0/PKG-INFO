        Cisco ACI app packager script
        
        This script will validate if the directory structure conforms to the specification
        and validates the app.json file. It creates a compressed file called <app_name>.aci
        where app name is taken from app.json. The ouput is created in the same directory
        where the app files are located.
        
        Execution
        ---------
        Package app along with signature and provide two command line arguments
        1. absolute path to directory where app files are located
        2. absolute path of file with private key
        
        Example:
        If /home/sunverma/my_app directory contains all the app files
        and /home/sunverma/private_key.pem contains the private key
        
        Packaging my_app with signature
        $ python aci_app_packager.py -f /home/sunverma/my_app -p /home/sunverma/private_key.pem
        
        Packaging my_app without signature
        $ python aci_app_packager.py -f /home/sunverma/my_app
        
        This script uses the "aci_app_validator.py" for package and file validation,
        hence aci_app_validator.py should be located in the same directory where
        pakaging script is running.
